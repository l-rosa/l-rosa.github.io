These articles address key technological advancements implemented at the Cuiabá Mine and highlight their impact on safety, productivity, and operational efficiency.\r\n\r\n                <br/><b>Enhancing Safety with Mobilaris People Tracking</b><br/>\r\nThe first article focuses on the implementation of the Mobilaris People Tracking System, which I commissioned shortly after joining AngloGold Ashanti in 2022. This groundbreaking system represents a milestone in underground personnel recognition by providing real-time tracking of workers within the mine.\r\n\r\nIt significantly enhances situational awareness during emergencies and evacuations, ensuring that every individual is accounted for and safely guided. By elevating operational safety to unprecedented levels, this system has become a benchmark for emergency management in mining operations worldwide.\r\n\r\n<br/><b>Boosting Productivity Through Data Integration</b><br/>\r\nThe second article explores the integration of Mobilaris People Tracking with its generated datasets to optimize mine productivity. In a challenging environment like Cuiabá Mine, with over 1,600 vertical kilometers and a vast ore body, logistical inefficiencies can lead to significant operational delays.\r\n\r\nBy leveraging the system's data, we have been able to reduce logistical losses, improve operational scheduling, and ensure a more efficient allocation of resources. This integration has proven transformative, allowing the mine to maintain a high level of productivity while overcoming the complexities of its unique environment.\r\n\r\n<br/><b>Low-Code Solutions for Complex Problems</b><br/>\r\nThe third article addresses the adoption of low-code programming practices to solve intricate challenges, particularly in managing expensive resources such as drilling and blasting tools. The development of a simplified and customizable interface allowed personnel with minimal computer skills to execute precise management tasks and provide actionable insights into operational continuity.\r\n\r\nThis innovative approach has led to greater accessibility and empowered a broader range of team members to contribute effectively to supply management and decision-making processes, driving operational efficiency and cost savings across the board.</div>\r\n                <img style={{ padding: 10}} src={require(\"../media/Slide37.jpg\")} alt=\"123\" className=\"w-50 p-3\"/>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"accordion-item\">\r\n                <h2 class=\"accordion-header\">\r\n                <button onClick={() => {setData(!data);}} class={data?\"accordion-button collapsed text-secondary bg-primary\":\"accordion-button collapsed\"} type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"#flush-collapseFour\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"flush-collapseFour\">\r\n                    Congress Participation - Speaker & Advisory Comittee\r\n                </button>\r\n                </h2>\r\n                <div id=\"flush-collapseFour\" class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\" data-bs-parent=\"#accordionFlushExample\">\r\n                <div class=\"accordion-body\">In 2023, I had the honor of being invited to present at the Hexagon Live Conference in Las Vegas, USA, one of the most prominent events in the field of digital technology and geospatial solutions.

It reflects AngloGold Ashanti’s commitment to innovation, operational excellence, and continuous improvement, aligning with the company’s vision of sustainable and responsible mining practices.\r\n\r\nThis achievement is a testament to the power of collaborative problem-solving and the pursuit of transformative solutions in the mining industry.</div>\r\n                <img style={{ padding: 10}} src={require(\"../media/Slide91.jpg\")} alt=\"123\" className=\"w-75 p-3\"/>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"accordion-item\">\r\n                <h2 class=\"accordion-header\">\r\n                <button onClick={() => {setProj(!proj);}} class={proj?\"accordion-button collapsed text-secondary bg-primary\":\"accordion-button collapsed\"} type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"#flush-collapseSix\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"flush-collapseSix\">\r\n                    1º Place Ventilation On Demmand Project - IBRAM Nomination\r\n                </button>\r\n                </h2>\r\n                <div id=\"flush-collapseSix\" class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\" data-bs-parent=\"#accordionFlushExample\">\r\n                <div class=\"accordion-body\">As the person responsible for the Mobilaris tracking system at AngloGold Ashanti’s Cuiabá Mine, I had the honor of contributing to the Demand-Based Ventilation Project, which won 1st place in the Best Practices in Mining Award by the Brazilian Mining Institute (IBRAM) in the Energy Efficiency category.\r\n\r\nThis groundbreaking project, implemented in the underground mine in Sabará (MG), integrated the personnel tracking system with the automated control of mine fans. The solution, based on automation logic, adjusts fan speeds according to the presence of workers in the operating zones, ensuring adequate airflow only where needed. In addition to enhancing worker safety, this innovation reduced energy consumption by up to 25%, establishing itself as a milestone in sustainability and operational efficiency within the mining sector.\r\n\r\nThe award, presented during EXPOSIBRAM 2024, recognized the project for its contribution to AngloGold Ashanti's decarbonization efforts, aligning with the company's global goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This achievement underscores the commitment to technological innovation integrated with environmental responsibility, positioning AngloGold as a leader in sustainable mining in Brazil.\r\n\r\nBeing part of this project was a significant milestone in my career, demonstrating the practical application of smart solutions that connect people, technology, and sustainability to transform operational challenges into tangible results.</div>\r\n                <p><a class=\"link-offset-1 text-secondary\" style={{ padding: 10}}
