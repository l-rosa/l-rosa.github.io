At the conclusion of my trainee program, I developed a Python script that integrated a coordinate measuring machine with a statistical software application for Fiat’s automotive factory. This achievement earned me an opportunity to deepen my expertise in Germany, where I focused on Python programming and autonomous measurement systems. Throughout my career, I have automated repetitive tasks using a variety of tools and technologies. Additionally, I completed a Certified Web Development program, where I gained proficiency in JavaScript (Node.js), HTML, CSS, Java, DevOps tools like Ansible and Terraform, AWS, and databases such as SQL. These experiences have honed my logical thinking and ability to develop efficient, scalable solutions.</div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"accordion-item\">\r\n                <h2 class=\"accordion-header\">\r\n                <button onClick={() => {setData(!data);}} class={data?\"accordion-button collapsed text-secondary bg-primary\":\"accordion-button collapsed\"} type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"#flush-collapseFour\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"flush-collapseFour\">\r\n                    Congress Participation - Speaker & Advisory Comittee\r\n                </button>\r\n                </h2>\r\n                <div id=\"flush-collapseFour\" class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\" data-bs-parent=\"#accordionFlushExample\">\r\n                <div class=\"accordion-body\">Since joining AngloGold Ashanti, I have specialized in integrating solutions through data. Working in the challenging environment of an underground mine—a sector traditionally resistant to technological change—I manage over 60 production control reports that drive insights and decision-making. My role requires expertise in SQL, PostgreSQL, PLC historians, and Excel, among other tools. I excel in transforming raw data into actionable insights and thrive in leveraging analytics to optimize operations.

The solution, based on automation logic, adjusts fan speeds according to the presence of workers in the operating zones, ensuring adequate airflow only where needed. In addition to enhancing worker safety, this innovation reduced energy consumption by up to 25%, establishing itself as a milestone in sustainability and operational efficiency within the mining sector.\r\n\r\nThe award, presented during EXPOSIBRAM 2024, recognized the project for its contribution to AngloGold Ashanti's decarbonization efforts, aligning with the company's global goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This achievement underscores the commitment to technological innovation integrated with environmental responsibility, positioning AngloGold as a leader in sustainable mining in Brazil.\r\n\r\nBeing part of this project was a significant milestone in my career, demonstrating the practical application of smart solutions that connect people, technology, and sustainability to transform operational challenges into tangible results.</div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <img src=\"http://ibram.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-2.jpg\" alt=\"123\" className=\"w-75 p-3\"/>\r\n
